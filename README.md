# CwStretch
‚Äúinteractive notebook for galaxy Classification with image Stretching‚Äù


An easy-to-use tool provides an interactive way to do visual classificaitons for astronomical imaging data. It uses Jupyter widgets and Matplotlib to display multi-filter image cutouts, with controls for stretch, zoom, and contour overlays to guide classificaitons.

<strong>‚ö° Main Strength of This Notebook:</strong><br>
Classifications are guided by the appearance of the images. Finding the optimal stretch ‚Äî or, in simpler terms, adjusting the contrast ‚Äî allows classifiers to better identify structures within the images. Allowing users to dynamically adjust the stretch/contrast can significantly improve the accuracy and ease of classification.

## ‚ú® Features
- Interactive Image Viewer
    - Load and visualize multi-filter galaxy cutouts for a list of object IDs.
    - Adjustable sliders for:
    - - Image stretch (percentile vmin / vmax)
    - - Contour level density
    - - Zoom factor (central cutouts)

- Classification widgets 
    - - Interactive features to classifiy with in the notebook, for a self-desinged classification scheme, and saved the results to a csv file for later analysis.

- Navigation & Data Management
    - - Buttons for stepping through different galaxy IDs.

## üì¶ Requirements

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib ipywidgets pandas astropy 
```

Enable interactive matplotlib for Jupyter

Call the following backend on the top of the notebook

```bash
%matplotlib widget
```

To allow it perform properly, you may need to 

```bash
pip install ipywidgets ipympl

#or 

jupyter labextension install @jupyter-widgets/jupyterlab-manager

```

## üõ† Workflow
Details in the Notebook
#### Step 0 ‚Äì Setup
- Run %matplotlib widget
- Import dependencies
#### Step 1 ‚Äì Load Images
- Customize IDs, filters_to_load, and input_dir
- Images load automatically when browsing galaxies
#### Step 2 ‚Äì Metadata
- Define IDs (list of sources)
- Optionally supply redshift_dict
- Add additional_info_dict if needed
#### Step 3 ‚Äì Classification Widgets
- Use the existing buttons and widgets or design your own widgets for
- - Adjust stretch, zoom or add contours with sliders
- - Buttons/selection for Classification workflow
- - Navigatiion through the multiple sources
#### Step 4 ‚Äì Plot cutouts
- Design functions to view your image cutouts
#### Step 5 ‚Äì Action for each widget
- Design Actions for each widget
#### Step 6 ‚Äì Run the display and fig.canvas cell to start your your classifications with stretch
